In Every Component, there will be one HTML file also called as Template file and one ts file also called component file.
Data Binding means transferring data between template and component files. 
There are two types of Data Binding
 i. one way data Binding: using one way data binding, we can transfer data from either template to component or component to template
    there are three possible ways:
    a. string interpolation: we can send data from component(TS) to template(HTML) using string interpolation. 
    it wraps the data between double braces
    ** string interpolation always takes value as a string
    b. property Binding: we can bind property values from component file to template file using propert binding
    it wraps the data between square brackets
    ** property binding can be used for dynamic classes or dynamic styling
    c. event binding: we can bind events data from template file to component file using event binding 
    it wraps the data between parenthesis
 ii. two way data binding: it builds commmunication between template and component at a time using a directives called [(ngModel)].
 To use ngModel, you have to import formsModule in main module file.
