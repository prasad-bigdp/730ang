rxJS: reactive extension for javascript.
it is used to deal asynchronous actions in angular
There are three major concepts in rxjs
  i. observable
  ii. subject
  iii. operators
  --- httpRequest returns obserbles
  --- buttons clicks/form submit may return observable
  --- routing may retuns obserbles

 1.  Observable: An obserbale is a series of asynchronous functions , got released by subscribing them
 Every obserble will have an observer and will have events like next,error,complete
 2.  Subjects: subjects are used to notify different components when any change happens in any one of the components.
 it is also a special type of observable that can multicast values to multiple components

 -- there are actually 4 types of subjects
 i. normal subject  -- will multi cast to multiple component
 ii. behaviour subject -- will multi cast to multi components but it starts with a default value
 iii. replay subject -- will multi cast to multple components again and again
 iv. async subject --it will send only the last emitted value

 3. operators: rxJS also provide some default functions which you can use for several purposes. these functions are called operators
 eg: of,map,from,filter etc..,
